# Ubuntu 24.04 Server Project
### This project simulates a Ubuntu 24.04 Server in a virtualised environment using VirtualBox. This lab builds foundational skills in Linux OS & networking.
<br>

## Objective
This project was created to simulate a basic Ubuntu 24.04 Server in VirtualBox. The goal was to gain a deeper understanding on Linux Systems, the CLI, & basic Linux server setup. By building this lab from the ground up, I aimed to gain hands-on experience with Linux systems & more confidence using the CLI as Linux is a dominant operating system in the server landscape.

## Skills Learned
- Virtualization: Installed and configured Ubuntu 24.04 server on VirtualBox. <br>
- System Setup: Performed initial server setup, including user creation, SSH configuration, and basic security hardening.  <br>
- Networking: Configured VirtualBox networking modes (NAT, Bridged, or Host-Only) for internet access and local connectivity. <br>
- Security: Applied basic server security practices (UFW firewall, disabling root login over SSH, package updates). <br>
- Command Line Proficiency: Gained hands-on experience with Linux terminal commands and system administration tools. <br>
- Package Management: Installed and managed software using apt, systemctl, and service management tools. <br>
- Filesystem Navigation: Learned Linux filesystem structure and how to manage files, directories, and permissions. <br>

## Tools Used
- VirtualBox – Virtualization platform used to run Ubuntu 24.04 server as a guest OS. <br>
- Ubuntu Server 22.04 – Lightweight and stable Linux distribution used for server configuration. <br>
- Terminal / Shell (Bash) – Primary interface for interacting with the server environment. <br>
- SSH – Secure remote access and management of the virtual server. <br>
- UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) – Simple firewall tool used to manage and configure basic network security. <br>
- APT (Advanced Package Tool) – Package manager used for installing and managing software on Ubuntu. <br>
- Netplan – Network configuration utility for setting up IP addresses and DNS. <br>  
- nano – Command-line text editors used to edit configuration files. <br>
